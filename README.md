# DotIPShield

DotIPShield enables you to record your intellectual property documentation to an immutable, verifiable database to aid with obtaining protection. IP registration and transaction timestamps prove when IP was created.
In the future, we plan on upgrading our platform to assist creators throughout the IP protection process.
